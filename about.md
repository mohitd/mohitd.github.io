![Mohit](/images/about/headshot.jpg "Mohit")

Hello World! My name is Mohit Deshpande! I currently work as a software development engineer at [Amazon Lab126](http://lab126.com/) in Sunnyvale, California on [Amazon Astro](http://amazon.com/astro)! My interests are in robotics, quantum computing, and C++.

I'm an alumnus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, and was a researcher in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the [Interactive Data Systems](interact.osu.edu) research group, led by [Dr. Arnab Nandi](www.arnab.org), that worked on information extraction from images for databases.
